# Robotics

## Diwali Vacation 2025 (18/10 to 25/10)

1. Learned about all the pins in Arduino and their function <br>
2. Learned syntax for programming an Arduino <br>
3. Designed circuit for line follower <br>
4. Wrote code for Line Follower <br>
5. Implemented a Motor driver in the design, but didn't write code due to time constraints. Hence submited the code for design without a Motor driver <br>
6. Tried to learn about PID, but due to complexity of topic, time constraint and travelling, couldn't implement it in the line follower
